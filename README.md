umm idfk what to put for the read me ngl

Here are some things though
First of this is HEAVILY inspired by the demonlist created by the team at pointercreate. most credit goes to them for 
inspiring me to make a seprate list foucusing on other leaderboard aspects of geometry dash. 
(pointer create github repo) ---->  https://github.com/stadust/pointercrate

Second off i am Completely open to any contributions from other people for the time being, as we are not as offical and
we are just three people putting out our own view of what these lists should look like. if intrested, dm me on (perferably) discord or twitter @grassismid

LISTS WE HAVE CAME UP WITH SO FAR :
Deco list - mainly centered around how good looking a level is, never centered around gameplay. For now it does not need to be rated to be put on this list, but it is mainly subject to change.
